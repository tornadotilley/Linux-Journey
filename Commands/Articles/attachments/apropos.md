`apropos` is a very useful command that let's us search the man pages from the command line. It is something like this:

`[ttilley@somelinux ~]$ apropos partition` 
- The output of this command gives us a list of commands and a count of how many times the search term is mentioned in the man pages. 
- This can also be performed with the [[man]] command with the `-k` flag.
