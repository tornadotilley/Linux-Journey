`head` displays the first ten lines of a file by default. 

`[ttilley@somelinux ~]$ head sometext.txt`

By default, this will have an output of the first ten lines of the .txt file. To modify this, we will use the `-n` flag for this command.

`[ttilley@somelinux ~]$ head -n 4 sometext.txt`

The output will be the first four lines of the text file.
