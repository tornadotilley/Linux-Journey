`gzip` expands and compresses files. There are several options for `gzip`:

- `-c` - Writes the output the standard output and keep the original files
- `-d` - Decompresses the file. Its also like typing `gunzip`.
- `-f` - Forces the compression even if a compressed version already exists. 
- `-h` - Help
- `-r` - This is for recursion; you would use this for directories
- `-t` - Tests the output. 
- `-v` - Verbose
- `-[number]` - 1 - 9. If you put a 1, the compression will be less; if you put a 9, the compression will be much more.
