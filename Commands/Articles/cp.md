`cp` is used to copy files. Below is a syntax example:

- `[ttilley@somelinux ~] cp somefile.md ~/somedirectory/` to copy a file to another directory
You can also copy multiple files with this command:
- `[ttilley@somelinux ~] cp somefile1.md somefile2.md` 
It is also possible to copy a file from another directory to another directory, independently of where you are in the file system:
- `[ttilley@somelinux ~] cp path/to/somefile.md path/to/somedirectory/` 

Below are some options to put at the end of the command.
