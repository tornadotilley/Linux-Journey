`man` takes you to the pages of the program's manual. `man` = manual. An example would be:

`[ttilley@somelinux ~]$ man cd`

- On most systems, `man` uses [[less]] to display the pages in a more readable format, instead of just showing everything in the terminal. All of those commands apply here. 
- To jump to a specific section of any 'man' page for a command, we can use the following syntax:
	- `[ttilley@somelinux ~]$ man [section] [search item]`
- 'Man' pages cover much more than just the user commands. Here is a chart for all of the different sections:
