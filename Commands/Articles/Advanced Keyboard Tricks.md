The commands in the command line are mostly shorthand for bigger words, `cp` copy, `rm` remove, etc. This is to prevent typos and to help us not to type as much. There is also another goal, to not lift our hands from the keyboard. For me, this improves my workflow tremendously. Below, I will make a list of keyboard tricks and tips.

*These commands are to be used when working in the terminal.* 
### **Moving the Cursor**
- CTRL+a - moves to the beginning of a command
- CTRL+e - moves to the end of the command
- CTRL+f - moves the cursor forward by one character
- CTRL+b - moves the cursor back one character
- ALT+f - moves the cursor forward by one word
- ALT+b - moves the cursor back by one word
- CTRL+l - clears the terminal screen
### **Modifying Text**
- CTRL+d - delete the character at the cursor location
- CTRL+t - transpose; exchanges the character with the one taht was behind it
- ALT+t - transposes the word with the preceding word 
- ALT+l - converts all of the characters of the following word to lowercase
- ALT+u - converts all of the characters of the following word to uppercase
### ~={red}Killing and Yanking Text=~
Killing refers to cutting text, and yanking refers to copying text. 
- CTRL+k - kills the text to the end of the line
- CTRL+u - kills text to the beginning of the line
- ALT+d - kills text to the end of the current word
- ALT+BCKSP - kills the text to the beginning of the current word
