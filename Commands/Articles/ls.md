The ls command displays a basic list of the files in the working directory. 

### Flags 
These are some of the flags for the ls command:
- `-F` - Distinguishes files from directories by adding the `/` to the end of the directory files. 
- `-a` - Lists all of the files in a directory, including the hidden ones; eg `.config`, `.bashrc`, etc.
- `-R` - Shows all of the files in the directories, along with the directories.
- `-l` - The long listing format. This includes much more information about the file. 
- `-h` - For displaying file sizes in human readable format instead of byte.
