`help` gives us access to the documentation of a command. If ever you are in need of help, you can always type something like this:

`[ttilley@somelinux ~]$ help cd`

Also, help can be written like this:
`[ttilley@somelinux ~]$ mkdir --help`

When you see `[text]` in the output, that just means that there is another option for an argument there. 

Some programs do not support the `--help`, but it's always worth a shot.
