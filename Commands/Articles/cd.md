The `cd` command stands for change directory. It can be use with the relative file path, or with the absolute file path. 

- `cd ..` - returns to the directory above the one that we were just in.
- `cd ~` - takes you to the home directory
- `cd ~user_name` - goes to the home directory of the current user
- `cd -` - takes you to the previous working directory
