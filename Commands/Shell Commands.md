*This article is functions as a landing page for all of the commands that will be running across*
Shell commands are very important to understand in bash scripting. I will be making a running list of all commands that I come across in my learning. I will also try to organize them at some point in the future.

### Tips & Tricks
*These are not in any particular order, I just list these as I come upon them.*

- Using the ';' character to separate commands on the same line is a helpful trick that I think is very beneficial
- [[Redirection]] is very helpful as a tool to view files with large outputs. This will allow you to be able to more easily view files. 
- 

### Special Characters
The characters for file globbing are right here. I will give a quick description of what they do. 
- ? - This is looking a certain number of characters before or after a string.
- * - This is looking for anything before or after a string
