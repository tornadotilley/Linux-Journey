There are a few main programs on Linux that allow us to compress and archive files. These are:

Compression
- [[gzip]] - expands and compresses files
- [[bzip2]] - a block sorting files compressor
Archive
- [[tar]] - Tape archiving utility
- [[zip]] - Package and compress files
Synchronization
- [[rsync]] - remote and directory synchronization

## Compression Types
When we use compression, there are two categories:
- Lossless - There is no data lost, and the decompressed version is the same as it was before.
- Lossy - There is data loss during the compression. The decompressed version is only a close approximation to the original.
