Commands can be one of 4 different things:

1. **An executable program** written in a programming language. 
2. **A command that is built into the shell itself**. 
3. **Shell function**. These are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment. 
4. **Aliases**. This is essentially a command that the user defines them self. 

### How to Identify Commands

We can use the [[type]] command to see what kind of command a command is. It works like this:

`[ttilley@somelinux ~]$ type cd`
